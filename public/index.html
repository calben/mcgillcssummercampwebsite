                <h2 class="section-heading">We&#39;ve got what you need!</h2>
                <p class="">Have you ever been puzzled by science? Have you tried to analyze exactly how a computer works? Are you good at problem solving, trouble-shooting, and coming up with original solutions? When people ask you about how many languages you are familiar with, do you answer: &ldquo;Three. English, French and Java? Then the place you want to be, from July 4th to July 8th 2011, is at McGill University&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be A Computer Scientist for a Week&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Sixty students from high schools across the Montreal area will be given the opportunity to live out their passion, and learn more about the intricate sides of Computer Science! The name &ldquo;computer science&rdquo;, or CS for short, might give the impression that we are trying to study computers, the every day machines we use for e-mail, chatting and watching movies. But CS is not about surfing the net, making charts with Excell and writing programs. Dijkstra, a famous computer scientist, once said: &ldquo;Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, CS is the theoretical study of computing systems and information. It deals with design principles, requirements analysis, and implementation of hardware or software to solve problems in biology, physics, pharmacy or economy. It is the study of algorithms and of methods for analyzing, testing and verifying concepts. To sum it all up, Computer Science offers you skills that can be applied to any discipline and help you solve the &ldquo;problems of the future&rdquo;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be A Computer Scientist for a Week&rdquo; is a free, but intensive camp. It&rsquo;ll take place on the McGill University campus, in the heart of downtown! This year we offer TWO themes: Mission to Mars and Game Programming Guru, so every morning you will attend a cool presentation about a different field of computer science, like graphics, artificial intelligence, or robotics! Then you&rsquo;ll have an in-class lecture, and be prepared to take notes because you will be given lab assignments and projects, that will be solved in teams. First, you&rsquo;ll be given simple programming assignments, and then they will progressively get complex. By the end of the camp, if you were in MISSION TO MARS - you will have designed and built artificial intelligent systems and programmed robotics! If you were in Game Programming Guru you will have learned about graphics and designed your own video game. But the most exciting part is that you get to meet 29 other students from across Montreal who share similar interests to you, and who might end up being your classmates in CEGEP or university!</p>

                        <p>The Electronic Arts camp exposes students to the world of computer graphics as it relates to the media industry, which includes the following areas: movies, animation and video games. The camp&rsquo;s focus is on video games and 3D modeling. Students will progress through all the stages a real games designer advances through when developing their own computer game. Students will learn the following things:
<ul> <li>A programming language</li> <li>An introduction to 3D Modeling</li> <li>Adding intelligence to games</li> <li>Simulating physics in games</li> </ul>
Day 1 and 2 of the camp are used as building blocks for the remaining days. During day one the student learns how to program a computer using the Java programming language. On day two they learn how to do 3D modeling using a modeling application program. Days 3 and 4 are used to add features and capabilities to the algorithms they developed during day 1 and 2. Day 3&rsquo;s capability advancement is artificial intelligent tricks that will make their algorithms more clever. In day 4 they will make their programs adaptable to physical constraints. Making games seamlessly intelligent and behave as if gravity and projectiles actually exist in the computer is a challenging and fun problem.
The last day of the camp is devoted to the BBQ and Competition. Each Competition Team will be asked to construct a player program that will reside in a multi-player game. Each of their automated-programmed players will compete with the other teams to see who is more intelligent and which can interact with physics better.
They will have Thursday afternoon and Friday morning to prepare. Points will be tallied and the best teams will receive 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes.
A tour will be organized to view the an industry grade gaming company. Last year our tour was with EA Games Montreal. We will also have the option to attend the Mars tour.</p>
